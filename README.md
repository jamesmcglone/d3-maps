# D3-maps README

We are making maps. Data comes from geojson/topojson files. 

## Get data and convert it into a readable filetype

This is a solid tutorial on how to gather geo data and what tools to use when cleaning up geo data and reducing file size.

## Deviations from tutorial

Found a tutorial on how to create d3.js map for China at the provincial level. Methods can also be applied to other subregional states provinces in other countries.
